### Project Title
## **post your work on github** ##

### Description
 This project is to use version control tool (Git), and git hub-as a hosting service - for creating repositories to create simulating a realistic workflow of the previous BikeShare .py project (the second project) using Git and posting the project into github and all of these as a type of getting version control using git and github into practice through this third project (post your project on GitHub) .

### First :- The BikeShare.py project

 I used the Anaconda 3(64 - bit)  to process the python code , as i used it to write the python code through spider editor and to import the Pandas packages ,and Numpy packages that supported me to write the python code as the following :
  * Import .csv Files into spider ,then
  * write the code many times till it results in the answers of the questions that i prepared to address the project 2 issues , then
  * i copied it into the work space and i uplode the BikeShare project2 file that contain the code that i wrote using spider editor in my local machine as another answer , in addition to text file data that include all questions that i addressed to process the project.

### Second :- post your work on GitHub
* this the last project (third one) and i followed the instructions in the [https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd104-ent/parts/e325d5cc-ccd1-4ca8-a562-7eed09ab76c7/modules/76f43c60-7219-439e-894f-59305ef97f47/lessons/e9652698-f014-4e98-b9dc-c89a868d9860/concepts/7529e6b3-5dc2-4f11-90f0-05cad3ed5653] to create this project  as the following:
 1. started with forking the repository from the link given Git Commands Documentation Template ( GitHub Project repository ).
 2. cloning the forked repository into my local directory as i called it project3 and turned it into repository .
 3. turning into the coloned repository through {cd  pdsnd_github}.
 4. adding the project2 files into the local repository through using copy "cp" and paste beside the README file .
 5. up dating README .MD file using atom code editor and save them in documentation branch .
 6. turning into master branch then into git GitHub.



### Files used
I used all the input files in the classroom that with the cloned repositories or files that i prepared using atom code editor, and i used in the this project (post your work on GitHub) the project2 files besides README file.
